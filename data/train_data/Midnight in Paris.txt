Woody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds its finality with "Midnight in Paris," the latest of <person>Allen's Parisian</person> brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. The good news is that <person>Allen</person> seems to be paying attention in a way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point of "Midnight in Paris" is that we've all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed. If anything, <person>Allen</person> seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.
