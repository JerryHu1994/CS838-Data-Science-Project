With the exception of one character (more later in this review), I found this movie filled with male, sophomoric humor. Having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it; kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equally.Unlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip, this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling non-stop for the first hour.Then, the introduction of the <person>Mr. Chow</person> part - essential for the plot, but played WAY over the top by <person>Ken Jeong</person> - became distracting. Up to that point, <person>Bradley Cooper</person>, <person>Ed Helms</person>, <person>Justin Bartha</person>, and <person>Zach Galifianakis</person> carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. <person>Zach Galifianakis</person>, in particular, was brilliant. Who is this guy???! The last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and I found the ending somewhat forced.HOWEVER, everyone I talked with after the movie will be seeing it again. This is one movie that is as funny as advertised.Of course, I will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes. Hey, just know what you're getting into when you see this.
