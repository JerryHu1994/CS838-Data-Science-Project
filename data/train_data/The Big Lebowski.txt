It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a <person>Raymond Chandler</person> potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence <person>Busbee</person> Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the <person>Coen</person> brothers put in developing The Dude (<person>Jeff Bridges</person>), <person>Walter</person> (<person>John Goodman</person>), <person>Donnie</person> (<person>Steve Buscemi</person> - tremendously endearing), and <person>Brandt</person> (magnificently played by <person>Phillip Seymour Hoffman</person>). Looking at the films use of <person>Sam Elliott</person> to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by <person>Jeff Bridges</person>, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by <person>Walter</person>, who <person>John Goodman</person> plays with charm and fury. The <person>Coen</person> brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the <person>Coens'</person> Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible.
