 This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. <person>Kevin Spacey</person> shines as <person>Lester Burnham</person>, and <person>Annette Bening</person> (<person>Carolyn Burnham</person>) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as <person>Wes Bentley</person> (<person>Ricky Fitts</person>), <person>Thora Birch</person> (<person>Jane Burnham</person>), <person>Mena Suvari</person> (<person>Angela Hayes</person>), and <person>Chris Cooper</person> (Col. <person>Frank Fitts</person>) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate <person>Sam Mendes</person> for his direction of this film, as well as <person>Alan Ball</person> for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.While billed by some as a "comedy-drama", I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.My Rating:  10/10
