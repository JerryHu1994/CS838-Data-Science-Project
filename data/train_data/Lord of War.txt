A movie about a gunrunner who arms the dictators, tyrants, and genocide-perpetrators of the world should not be this deliciously funny. Lord of War is story-telling perfection. The opening scene depicts the life of a bullet, from its creation in the factory to the moment it blasts through the head of a poor African child. <person>Nicolas Cage</person> is <person>Yuri Orlov</person>, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, who becomes the world's most successful arms dealer. Writer/director <person>Andrew Niccol</person> took every major world conflict of the part 25 years and seamlessly incorporated them into a smart, funny, complex story about violence, corruption, and the essence of warfare. Lord of War has no clear-cut, black-or-white, good-or-evil "moral of the story," but no intelligent observation ever does. It's just a fabulous film. "I never sold to <person>Osama Bin Laden</person>,” <person>Yuri</person> tells the audience. "Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then."
