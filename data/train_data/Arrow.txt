OK, just seen the first episode and I think it was amazing. I am not the biggest fan of comics or very knowledgeable about Green Arrow in general, so I feel I can be very objective in reviewing this show like I would any regular one, without fan-love ideas or huge expectations. The characters seem very believable so far, few minor doubts here and there but nothing crucial; acting also up to part. Story is realistic, without that fantastical loop holes that comic adaptations usually have (was told Green Arrow was like that in comics too, so I respect the decision to stay with that). CGI was decent, compliments to stunt collection and fighting choreography (well done, sir, well done), and quite good screenplay for this episode. The makers opened quite a few questions, made room for many ways show can stream to; I can say without a doubt, that this show is one of the surprises of this fall and I can only hope that the whole season lives up to this great pilot.
