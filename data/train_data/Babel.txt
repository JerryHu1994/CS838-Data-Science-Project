Babel is my film of the year, and probably the best film I've seen in  quite a few years.The film looks at relationships, from husband/wife, parent/children,  brother/sister and plays around the themes of love in adversity. The  characters are all interlinked in a very random way, it's a little like  10 degrees of separation.The film is set in Morocco, Mexico, Japan and the US, and the director  makes full use of the different backdrops to bring the picture alive.The characters are deep and insightful, each has a problem to face up  to and the subtle, naturalistic way their issues play out make for  truly emotional cinema. This is not a film about heroes, it's a film  about trying to make the right choices when your back is to the wall,  and the doubts that go with this.Great movie, especially if you're a parent as your protective instincts  will kick in at least once during this movie!
