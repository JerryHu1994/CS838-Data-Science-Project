I went to see this having read a few reviews, I also heard a review from a friend that <person>Richard Wilkins</person> on Australian critic had said it wasn't that good. Well, I have no idea what film they saw, but it wasn't the one I saw. The start was a little slow, but still threw in some moments of concern to keep one on the edge. As the film settled on, it kept moving at a good pace. Story was a basic love story, mixed in with morality, but basically, love story. Cgi was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, stunning even. All the main characters were easy on the eye too, always making it easier to want to watch. Plot wasn't sophisticated, probably described as feel good, but frankly, it was perfect. I left a 2 hour film and wasn't bored for a second. <person>Cruise</person>, for all the press on him and his supposed kookiness, I don't care, he carried the film..... GO SEE THIS, pure entertainment.
