 Everyone complains about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of my friends and I used to argue for months on end about which <person>Indian Jones</person> film was the superior. Almost anyone we ask say that Temple of Doom is their least favorite, and the worst in the Jones trilogy. I believe the only reason people say this, is because it's the middle film, sandwiched between an all time classic, and a Hollywood blockbuster. To me, there is NO question that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the far superior <person>Indiana Jones</person> film. To anyone who says Last Crusade is the best I can do nothing but disagree (let me point out that all THREE films are nothing short of phenomenal). Temple of Doom had so much to live up to after the first film, and instead of trying to re-create Raiders (something I feel Crusade did), <person>Lucas</person> and <person>Spielberg</person> decided to take the franchise in a new direction. In my opinion, this was a great idea. Crusade and Raiders are too similar: both of them take place in desert terrain, both have <person>Indy</person> going after a very famous, biblical artifact, and both have <person>Indy</person> fighting off the Nazi's from attaining this object for global domination. Without Temple of Doom, Last Crusade would be an obvious copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A different style of <person>Indy</person> film is needed to expand the trilogy, making <person>Indiana Jones</person> a truly global character, and Temple of Doom did just that.The film itself is a non-stop action, adventure ride. <person>Harrison Ford</person> is once again AMAZING as the dashing professor/archaeologist thrill seeker. <person>Short Round</person> is a loveable character who adds a humorous touch, and reveals the more compassionate side of <person>Indy's</person> character. The ceremony scenes are truly breathtaking and tense. During these scenes the film contains some very graphic images, but are used justifiably to convey the real dark, feel of this film (i.e. the removing of the man's heart while he's still alive, and lowering him into a fiery pit). The mine cart chase scenes are the most amazing, fast moving action sequence in any of the Indy films, and you feel like you're on a roller coaster each time you watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy, it's hard to pick a best and worst film, in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own, and really shouldn't be compared to the other two.
