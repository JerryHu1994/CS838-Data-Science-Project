 Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.  Humour for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?From <person>Marty's</person> "Johnny B Goode" to Doc's classic "Run For It Marty!" You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel "Save The Clock Tower!"It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous <person>Lea Thompson</person>, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager <person>Marty</person> make this film a must for all young at heart.
