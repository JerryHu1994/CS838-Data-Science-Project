Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of <person>Ron Perlman</person> and what he brought to the picture.This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of <person>Ron Perlman</person> and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. <person>Perlman</person> is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. <person>Rick Baker</person> should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.<person>Doug Jones</person> is awesome as the body of <person>Abe Sapien</person>. His movements are truly beautiful. And <person>David Hyde Pierce</person> as the voice is perfect. <person>Abe</person> is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than <person>Hellboy's</person>.<person>John Hurt</person> is great in this, as is <person>Jeffrey Tambor</person>. Everyone in this does a great job. But <person>Perlman's</person> performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater.
