<person>Lindsay Lohan</person> plays a teen girl trying to get along at a new high school. This time, she plays a girl home schooled in Africa, whose first experience at a public school is marred by a clique of nasty girls called the Plastics, who use gossip and other torture techniques to try to ruin her social life.The story makes it sound like another generic teen film but this one is actually quite funny and realistic. The most cynical person will point out that this is a cheap rip off of Heathers and they are similar. While Heathers is a good movie, mean Girls is an even better movie. I think Mean Girls is very good for a number of reasons. First, the script is actually creative and smart. <person>Tina Fey</person> seems to understand that teens want comedies they can relate to and she did that with Mean Girls. Of course, there were a few lame scenes but nothing that kills the film. <person>Tina Fey</person> should leave SNL and focus on her career in movies.Second, the acting is very good and convincing. <person>Rachel McAdams</person> offers the best and funniest performance as <person>Regina</person>. Her character is very mean (hence the title) yet I found it so hard to actually hate her. She has this charm that sucks the audience in on her and its so hard to hate her. <person>Lindsay Lohan</person> also gives a good performance as <person>Cady</person>. Her best scenes are with <person>Rachel</person>. They have very good chemistry together. The other plastics are played by <person>Lacey Chabert</person> and <person>Amanda Seyfried</person>. They also give good performances and the scenes that have all the plastics together are very entertaining. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty good and <person>Tina Fey</person> also has a small role as <person>Cady's</person> math teacher.Another reason why Mean Girls is so good is because it's actually funny for people over the age of 21. It's not just for teens but also for adults. <person>Mark Waters</person> is proving to be very good at directing harmless comedies like Freaky Friday and this one. He keeps the film short yet enormously entertaining. I really don't understand how someone could actually give this movie a one. I understand some people finding it over the top or stupid but it doesn't deserve a one. In the end, this smart and funny teen movie deserves to be seen. Rating 8/10
