This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving film. <person>Martin Scorcese</person> has created a seminal work -- one that brings the harrowing, big-studio, adult movie making of the 1970's and totally reinvents and reinvigorates it for today's audience.The story traces the rise and demise of billionaire <person>Howard Hughes</person> as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in a life unfettered by concerns of money, talent or opportunity. Whether trying to get a plane off the ground or a young starlet into bed, <person>Hughes</person> attacks life with a fierce gusto -- plagued and prodded by obsessive compulsive germphobia that constantly threatens to consume and defeat him.<person>DiCaprio</person> is amazing! It's the performance no one thought he was capable of. It is a dynamic, smart, funny, articulate, intense, mature and ultimately harrowing performance that relaunches his career as one of American's finest actors. At the end of the film, you just want to take him in your arms and sob. It's really that good.<person>Cate Blanchett</person> is incredible as <person>Katherine Hepburn</person>. At first, I was a little thrown by how bravely she attacked the <person>Hepburn</person> trademark voice, but I was completely won over by the second line. It is a tender, funny, incredibly convincing star turn that supplies the heart for the first half of the film. The scene where she takes <person>Howard</person> home "for dinner" with the family is a classic! <person>Kate Beckinsale</person> does a surprisingly fine job with <person>Eva Gardner</person> -- conveying the slow burning passion of this Hollywood icon without ever lapsing into mere mimicry.But, in the end, this isn't a love story -- it's a war story -- a war between <person>Howard's</person> unstoppable will and his fierce inner demons battling for <person>Howard's</person> soul. It is the major relationship in the movie and the true heart of the film -- one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart. He tries to ignore it by sleeping with every beauty in town. He tries to outrun it, building faster and faster airplanes. Yet, it is his one constant companion from early childhood to his ultimate, inescapable end. And it is this relationship that leaves you devastated at the end of the film.Brilliant!
