If there was one word that I could use to describe <person>Martin Scorsese's</person> "Goodfellas": it'd be priceless.A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of <person>Henry Hill</person> who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and <person>Nicholas Pileggi's</person> book "Wiseguy").There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by <person>Ray Liotta</person>, <person>Robert De Niro</person>, <person>Joe Pesci</person> (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and <person>Paul Sorvino</person> are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director <person>Martin Scorsese</person> lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit.
