If you're expecting a character driven storyline or you're someone that is unable to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours then this movie probably won't be for you.The storyline is nothing new and has been explored quite a few times, it's basically the concept of are we more or can we be more than what we are.Whilst they used an idea about the brain that has long since been proved nothing more than a myth it works to drive the concept of the film. I do think with a little thought they could of made this a little bit more believable though if they had just focused on being able to use more of the brains potential rather than "capacity".Anyway apart from the basic concept that we still do not really understand our brains and what they are capable of everything else in the movie is based a lot in the realm of fantasy. There was a whole lot of things in the movie that could of been done better but even with all those flaws I still found it entertaining.The only thing that let the film down for me was the ending which even though visually was probably the best part of the film it still felt a little too generic and overdone.There seems to be a lot of reviews on here that bang on about realism and it being unbelievable etc but if you are going to rate a film on that then recent films like Transformers and all the super hero movies should be rated a 1 because hey a school student getting bitten by a radioactive spider or super sized robots trying to overtake earth is far more believable...This film is a fantasy sci-fi with great visuals and while not "realistic" or perfectly executed has a thought provoking concept.
