I can gladly say that <person>David Ayer's</person> World War II flick 'Fury' lived up to my expectations. The audience are confronted with the horrors of war, accompanied with some truly spectacular well-crafted battle scenes that proves <person>Ayer's</person> desire to create something new and profound. <person>Ayer</person> keeps the gritty realism he employed on his other acclaimed films only this time uses it to depict the journey of a tank crew in Germany in 1945. The performances are strong from <person>Brad Pitt</person>, <person>Logan Lerman</person> and even <person>Shia LaBeouf</person> has proved he has a hidden acting talent after his heyday on the set of 'Transformers'. An emotional war-drama that packs a punch with visceral action scenes and an atmospheric score, definitely worth a watch.
