This movie is truly, truly OUTSTANDING! I am in complete shock over the performances in this film. &&&Nick Nolte$$$, as usual, gives a gritty, gut wrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees. One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. &&&Nolte$$$ was Rich Man, Poor Man, absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. &&&Hardy$$$ and Mr. &&&Edgeron$$$ were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them by far! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could not wait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie that certainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod for &&&Nick Nolte$$$, and if it were up to me, Mr. &&&Hardy$$$ and Mr. &&&Edgeron$$$ would walk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop what you are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly what being a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!
