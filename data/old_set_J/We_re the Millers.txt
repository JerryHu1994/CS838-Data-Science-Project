I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer, because I thought it looked hilarious, and I'm a huge fan of &&&Jason Sudeikis$$$ and I absolutely adore &&&Jennifer Aniston$$$, and I can guarantee that it does not disappoint. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be, because you don't usually expect much from drug dealing comedies. The plot in this was actually pretty clever, and to be honest &&&Will Poulter's$$$ character &&&Kenny$$$ really makes the entire movie. He played it so well, and he was perfectly awkward and strange, it was hilarious. It was definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. Sure it did have some corny moments that are unrealistic, but I overall enjoyed the movie.
