I was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and attended the Q&A after with &&&James Duncan$$$, &&&Vera Farmiga$$$, &&&Michelle Monaghan$$$, &&&Jake Gyllenhaal$$$ and &&&Ben Ripley$$$. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between &&&Jake$$$ and &&&Michelle$$$ which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make Chicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it feels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this film delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly recommended.
