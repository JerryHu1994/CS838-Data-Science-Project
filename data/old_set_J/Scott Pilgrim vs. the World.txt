I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every &&&Wright$$$ film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. &&&Wright's$$$ trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the &&&Seinfeld$$$ scene.Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of &&&Edgar Wrights$$$ films or just good silly humour you will love this film.Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 &&&Morgan$$$
