To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. &&&Cumberbatch$$$ is a fantastic choice for &&&Sherlock Holmes$$$ - he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. &&&Martin Freeman$$$, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for &&&Holmes$$$ without being the dumb sidekick that Dr &&&Watson$$$ has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after &&&Robert Downey's$$$ interesting take on &&&Conan Doyle's$$$ characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything.
