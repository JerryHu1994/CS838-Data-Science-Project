I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from &&&Pat$$$ and &&&Tiffany$$$. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the "silver lining" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. &&&Jennifer Lawrence$$$ and &&&Bradley Cooper$$$ are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November.
