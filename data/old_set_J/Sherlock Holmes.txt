Do &&&Guy Ritchie$$$ and &&&Sherlock Holmes$$$ fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic &&&Downey$$$ Jr. and &&&Law$$$ are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. &&&Downey$$$ is &&&Holmes$$$ and &&&Law$$$ is sidekick Dr. &&&Watson$$$, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord &&&Blackwood$$$ (a perfectly grave and menacing &&&Mark Strong$$$) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. &&&Rachel McAdams$$$ also shows up as &&&Irene Adler$$$, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of &&&Holmes$$$.&&&Downey$$$ Jr. brings quick-wit, cunning, and a scruffy toughness to a role long seen as stuffy and dry, while &&&Law$$$ a distinguished charm that, at times, spills over into testy aggressiveness (which is funniest at &&&Holmes$$$ most annoying). Both toss off the one-liners with ease. &&&Ritchie's$$$ directorial style also comes through, from the dark, grimy Victorian- London production values to the violent boxing and martial arts matches. &&&Holmes'$$$ mindset (such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect, interpret clues, follow the deceptive) also brings out &&&Ritchie's$$$ ability to create an ultra-stylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action set-pieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot, by three screenwriters, is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plot-twist on-top of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style, you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's &&&Sherlock Holmes$$$, but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless.
