 This has to be by far one of the cleanest and most well-designed movie to come from any studio for a while now. The plot is trim and concise and this film is not just for kids, there are plenty of grown-up themes to satisfy even critical viewers. The animation is tremendous, especially if you pay attention to the details, and the cameo from &&&Geri$$$ and the underlying Star Wars spoofs are just great. All in all, one of the best films I've seen to date. Just one disappointment, no outtakes during the credits. But still, I don't think I'll forget this one for a while, if you get a chance to see it in the cinemas don't miss it...
