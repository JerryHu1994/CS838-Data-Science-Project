In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop &&&Jake Hoyt$$$ (&&&Hawk$$$) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer &&&Alonzo Harris$$$ (&&&Washington$$$) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately &&&Hoyt$$$ is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by &&&Alonzo's$$$ nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where &&&Hoyt$$$ tells &&&Harris$$$ he will do "anything you want me to do", the situations &&&Hoyt$$$ is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing &&&Hoyt$$$ to decide which side &&&Harris$$$ is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether &&&Hoyt$$$ is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for &&&Harris$$$ to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won &&&Denzel$$$ the Oscar that year for Best Actor!! A must watch
