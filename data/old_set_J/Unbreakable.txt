 I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days, the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits, and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.I've seen this movie several times, and I have never even gotten tired of it.  It does deal with comic books, but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies.  The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comic-book world, at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comic-book movie, others a brilliant comic-book movie. And yet, there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comic-book movie. It's more of a drama, just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie.  Both are excellent dramas, but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement, and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comic-book.  I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue, making full use of subtle gestures, movements, and actions to represent the character's thoughts.  The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.In the end, there are a number of things in this movie that can cause people to quickly denounce the movie, but these are all dependent upon perspective, as there's nothing truly wrong with the movie.  In fact, if viewed objectively and with an open mind, the viewer might be much more apppreciative of Unbreakable.It's clear that many of the posters to this comments area were truly angered by the movie and did not think their thoughts through prior to writing their comments, which is a shame as Unbreakable truly deserves better.  If &&&M. Night Shyamalan's$$$ next movie is at least half as good as Unbreakable, I'll definitely be in line to buy a ticket.
