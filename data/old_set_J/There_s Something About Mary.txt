 A lot of my friends said they hated this, but after i saw it and loved what I saw, it became apparent that many of these people hadn't seen it, they just KNEW they would hate it from the degradingly mysoginistic slapstick it supposedly represented.  Sorry, wrong movie.  This is a classic satire, replete with balladeer narrator.  The gags flow fast and funny and expertly walk the tightrope between politically incorrect and unkind.  This is surprisingly a movie that is very true to itself and its characters with a lot of plotlines that tie up nicely in unusual ways.  And, it's a feel-good movie too.  &&&Cameron Diaz$$$ and &&&Ben Stiller$$$ are marvelous together in the leads.
