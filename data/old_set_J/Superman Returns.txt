First off don't take advice on whether or not to see this movie from someone who didn't like the original film, doesn't know how to spell kal-el, and/or thinks Smallville is the only good representation of the superman story. Don't get me wrong I like smallville. I watch it all season because the writers will give me at least 3 very good episodes...but thats out of an entire season. That leaves a lot of crappy episodes too. That being said Tom Welling is great and &&&Michael Rosenbaum$$$ is the best Lex I've ever seen. On to this movie... The casting is genius. &&&Brandon Routh$$$ is amazing...not only does he capture the role of Superman perfectly. He recaptures the &&&Clark$$$ that &&&Christopher Reeves$$$ showed us. Its almost uncanny you'll see what I mean. The story line is where everyone gets hung up, but you just have to give it a chance. You have to look at it this way. &&&Singer$$$ had the choice of whether or not to show us the same story we've all seen before or to come with something totally new. And thats what He did he brought us a story we haven't seen before we don't automatically know how this will end or even where he is going with it in the next film. But thats good. With Hollywood overrun with remakes and regurgitated story lines its exciting to NOT know where this is going. Another complaint you might hear is the pace. "Its not as action packed as spiderman 2 or x-men 2 it didn't live up to potential". For this answer you have to remember X-men 1. &&&Singer$$$ likes to build a base storyline to work with. X-men 1 was not near as action packed as the 2nd one. But he built the characters. I feel like thats what he did in this film. He works a little character development in. It does slow up the pace and make the movie a little long. But I think overall the next film will benefit from it. So I would definitely recommend seeing this film...maybe not the latest showing. But its the first must see of the summer. I'm ready to see it again already
