Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars &&&Paul Walker$$$ as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding &&&Vin Diesels'$$$ character. &&&Diesel$$$ plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. &&&Walkers'$$$ character, &&&Brian$$$, way into the world is through &&&Dominic Toretto$$$ (&&&Diesel$$$). &&&Toretto$$$ has an air about him which draws other in, and &&&Brian$$$ is no different. Throughout the movie, &&&Brian$$$ is getting to know &&&Dom$$$, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both &&&Dom$$$ and &&&Brian$$$ are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between &&&Dom$$$, &&&Mia$$$, &&&Vince$$$, &&&Letty$$$, and the others is amazing.If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight
