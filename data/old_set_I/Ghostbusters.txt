 I have special affection for this film. When I was a youngster, growing up between the ages of four and ten, this was my favorite film. I loved the whole Ghostbusters thing. I loved the sequel, the cartoon series, I had to have the toys and merchandise every Christmas, you name it. Strangely, as I have gotten older, I find myself appreciating the film more and more. When I was a child I loved it for the special effects, the gadgets and the ghostbusting especially. Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I'm older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like &&&Venkman's$$$ line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like &&&Slimer$$$ being the ghost of &&&John Belushi$$$ and &&&Venkman$$$ rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80's hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.Unlike many of today's blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against &&&Slimer$$$, &&&Gozer$$$ and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80's, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. &&&Bill Murray$$$, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as &&&Peter Venkmen$$$ who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the "there is no Dana, only Zool" moment. &&&Murray's$$$ priceless reaction to &&&Dana Barrett's$$$ possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as &&&Murray$$$, we have co writers &&&Dan Akyroyd$$$ and &&&Harold Ramis$$$ sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, &&&Sigourney Weaver$$$ making a wonderful damsel in distress, &&&Rick Moranis$$$ is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a  neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while &&&Ernie Hudson$$$ and &&&Annie Potts$$$ both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.Add to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made.
