Just got back from a press screening. Horrible Bosses is an easy to relate to comedy that keeps you engaged and amused all the way. Some great scenes involving crude/sexual/racial humor that catch you off guard and have you rolling. The plot is a little forced, as was the ending, which is partially forgivable in the case of a comedy, as long as it makes you laugh. Seeing &&&Kevin Spacey$$$ play asshole boss brought back fond memories (Swimming With Sharks), he pulls it off very well. &&&Jennifer Aniston$$$ very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome. &&&Charlie Day$$$ was amazing, and resembles his character in always Sunny in Philly (personal fav). Overall, not quite for the collection, but definitely worthwhile a trip to the movie theater!
