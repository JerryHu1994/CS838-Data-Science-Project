&&&Christopher Nolan's$$$ second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. &&&Christian Bale$$$ delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally &&&Alfred$$$ (played superbly by &&&Michael  Cane$$$) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is &&&Heath Ledger$$$ as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as &&&Jack  Nicholson$$$ was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and &&&Ledger$$$ gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as &&&Aaron Eckhart$$$, &&&Maggie Gyllenhaal$$$  and more. I must say though I liked &&&Katie Holmes$$$, &&&Gyllenhaal$$$ gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. &&&Bale$$$ and &&&Gyllenhall$$$ have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than &&&Holmes$$$. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.Also worth mentioning is screenwriter &&&Jonathan Nolan$$$, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  &&&Christopher Nolan$$$, &&&Christian Bale$$$, and especially &&&Heath Ledger$$$ (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. &&&Nolan's$$$ talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over &&&Ledger's$$$ death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember &&&Heath Ledger$$$ and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter &&&Matilda  Ledger$$$. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.Rest in peace. &&&Heath Ledger$$$: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.
