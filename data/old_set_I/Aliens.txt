 I rate Aliens a perfect 10.  This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private &&&Hudson$$$).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the "old fashioned way" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!
