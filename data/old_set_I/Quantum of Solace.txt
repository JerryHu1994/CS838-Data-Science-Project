This is my first review in IMDb (my first port-of-call for movie opinions) and unfortunately it's simply a reaction to what has been, this morning, a disappointing experience.Unlike Casino Royale, which was as direct as a bullet from a gun, QoS spends a sizeable chunk of it's running time meandering aimlessly.Firstly though, the intro car chase is in the style of an agitated, edit-obsessed director which means the entire scene is viewed in short random bursts from a multitude of angles - Fine, if that's your bag.What follows is a series of action set pieces which are at turns exciting, manic and messy, but after which the film becomes flat and a little direction-less. That's not to say that there is little in the way of bullets and babes but the simple facts are that the set pieces are really not very exciting, and worse still the characters are pretty bland, in comparison to those in Casino Royale.You'll struggle to think of a main bond villain that is less interesting than &&&Dominic Greene$$$, and agent &&&Fields$$$ is utterly pointless in every aspect other than brief eye-candy.As is mentioned in other reviews it is &&&Judy Dench$$$ and &&&Daniel Craig$$$ that keep this movie from leaving the tracks entirely but it doesn't bode well for future outings if this is to be the new template.In short Casino Royale rejuvenated the franchise but Quantum Of Solace has gone some way to spoiling it's success.The theme song isn't too good either, and just like the film it gets a tad messy at times. Get &&&Chris Cornell$$$ back for the next one.
