Any movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving cheering is an excellent movie. It is like &&&Rocky$$$ on adrenaline and with a whole lot better acting. &&&Hugh Jackman$$$, &&&Evangeline Lilly$$$ and &&&Dakota Goyo$$$ all have great performances. &&&Dakota$$$ who plays the son really makes the movie, but all the actors performances are great. The guy who thought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead. Real Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a long time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath. Great movie.
