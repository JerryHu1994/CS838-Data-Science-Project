I think The Fifth Element is the movie I have seen the most... It is a perfect mixture of action and comedy, science-fiction, suspense and romance. Set in a not so far future, the eternal battle between good and evil is shown to us in an extravagant setting. Flying cars, aeroplanes that go at the speed of light, weird creatures and ugly aliens are only a few things that are present during this film. The story has never been seen before : Good has only one weapon to defeat evil; it is composed of four stones representing the four element (water, earth, fire and air) and a perfect creature. These five elements have to be united before the forces of evil arrive to earth. But evil has found help and the stones have disappeared. &&&Bruce Willis$$$ (one of the best action actors of our time), &&&Milla Jovovich$$$, &&&Ian Holm$$$ and &&&Gary Oldman$$$ make the suspense even more intense. &&&Chris Tucker$$$ is incredibly funny and ads a lot to the comic side of the film. The story is extremely imaginative and is, in my opinion, one of &&&Luc Besson's$$$ best. I have never seen anything else like it. The costumes, designed by &&&Jean-Paul Gaultier$$$, are unbelievably imaginative and fun. They are a big part of the extravagance and originality of the movie. The score, by &&&Eric Serra$$$ (one of my favourites) is simply a work of art. And last but not least, the special effects are absolutely excellent, adding to the quality of the movie. If you are looking for action and a good laugh, this is the film to see. But the actors are not the only things that make this film worth seeing. Click here
