When I thought about &&&Francis Urquhart$$$ of the original House of Cards series, I could not help but imagine &&&Kevin Spacey$$$ in a way that was similar but a role of his own making. &&&Spacey's$$$ role of &&&Francis Underwood$$$, in Netflix's original series, is nothing short of a tour de force. The convenience of being able to watch the whole season right away is also something to mention as a new, fresh and exciting method of television excellence. No longer do we have to wait and be fed slowly the episodes as we wonder what might happen and find ourselves somewhat disappointed -- now we can be swept away. And that's exactly what will happen to you when you sit down to watch this. 13/10.
