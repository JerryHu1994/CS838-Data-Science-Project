The films belonging to The Fast and the Furious saga have been increasing the ambition of the stunts and action scenes with every new sequel, while the screenplays have been getting more tangled and apparatus in order to guarantee the numerous cast to have enough moments of individual showcasing. Furious 7 isn't the exception, and I found it very entertaining, while it elevated the level of drama and motoring stunts beyond any reason or logic... which is exactly what we expect in a film from this franchise. Besides, the sad death of actor &&&Paul Walker's$$$ brings a gravity to the story which the screenplay could have never generated by itself. I think that, until now, I could found the validity in the wordiness about "family", which has been repeated many times by &&&Vin Diesel$$$ in the films of this saga (I counted at least four instances in Furious 7). I wish that this new emotional weight hadn't been due to such tragic reasons, but it undoubtedly influenced my perception of the film. Anyway... what people want to see are the action scenes, and Furious 7 completely fulfills the expectations in that regard, with a series of outlandish stunts which are totally improbable but very entertaining. Screenwriter &&&Chris Morgan$$$ found an appropriate balance between action and story, and director &&&James Wan$$$ made a fluid and dynamic work. Editorial comment: the quantity and complexity of the stunts displayed in Furious 7 are making some people talk about the possibility of introducing a special category for stunt doubles at the Oscars; and I think that's an excellent idea. There's undoubtedly digital manipulation in those scenes (erasing of cables, face replacement, general retouch), but there's still an extraordinary mechanic, pyrotechnic and logistical talent involved in the shooting of those scenes, something which would deserve a formal recognition by the Oscars. There are currently two categories dedicated to the technicians who mix the audio of car crashes... and none to the drivers who risked their lives? Ridiculous. End of the editorial comment. The veteran actors of the saga do their usual stuff in Furious 7, as it can be supposed. As for the additions of the cast, &&&Jason Statham$$$ makes a perfect work as one of the villains, but the great &&&Djimon Hounsou$$$ is completely wasted as the terrorist who wants to steal a magical application of digital espionage. &&&Kurt Russell$$$ brings an appropriate style and personality to his character. And the female fight scene between &&&Michelle Rodriguez$$$ and &&&Ronda Rousey$$$ is inferior to the similar ones in which &&&Gina Carano$$$ was involved in the previous film. I don't know whether this saga is going to continue without &&&Walker$$$; it probably will, considering the huge quantities of money these films generate. My favorite movie from this franchise keeps being the fifth one (Fast Five), but I can recommend Furious 7 as a very competent action film, and as a solid tribute/final chapter in case they decide to stop here.
