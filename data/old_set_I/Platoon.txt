 Platoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all time. While this is certainly true, what's often overlooked -- at least after only one run through the film -- is that it's chiefly a tale of God vs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt, Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.The story is told from the point of view of &&&Chris Taylor$$$ (solidly played by &&&Charlie Sheen$$$), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks is his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, &&&Chris$$$ is shown in the uncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment, let alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we're introduced to the well-known facets of the Vietnam War: The lack of sense of purpose, the wraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among the fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause widespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical value.&&&Chris$$$ sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. &&&Elias$$$ (&&&Willem Dafoe$$$) and Sgt. &&&Barnes$$$ (&&&Tom Berenger$$$). These two really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally the same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that &&&Elias$$$ is Good, and &&&Barnes$$$ is Evil (the "enemy" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all -- it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won't deny it is a very black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel contrived. &&&Elias$$$ feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; &&&Barnes$$$ fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point aptly put by &&&Chris Taylor$$$ himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.&&&Elias$$$/&&&Barnes'$$$ hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through several war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our soldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity of certain soldiers, including of Sgt. &&&Barnes$$$, is unflinchingly shown here. It leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding of the similarly empty look on a woman's face after she sees her son killed in front her.&&&Elias$$$ doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. &&&Elias$$$ and &&&Barnes$$$ come closer and closer to open conflict, as &&&Taylor$$$ becomes a veteran, obviously siding with &&&Elias$$$. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.Don't watch this movie for the action. That's not to say it's not well shot, or unrealistic. On the contrary. It's quite convincing. But it doesn't show war as a fun sport, and it's never a question of good guys versus bad guys. There will be no cheering for the "good guys" or anyone else in this one. &&&Stone$$$ succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all, and it's not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish, either).On the other hand, if you want great acting, it's here. &&&Dafoe$$$ and &&&Berenger$$$ do incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically sounding) script. &&&Barnes$$$ is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him, drinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don't make a move, and neither will you, though you'll hate him just as much as them. &&&Dafoe$$$ is a ray of light in the dark as &&&Elias$$$. The cast is rounded out with many characters, all well played, and adding another dimension to the film.The technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about them much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem quite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film, however, is the music. It's emotional and draining, and used to great effect -- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10
