I'll start straight off the cuff. &&&Niccol$$$ is one of my favourite writer/directors. In fact, one of my favourite films is Gattaca, which has been so under-rated over the years since its release. To me he's been a great Sci-Fi writer, so going into this I was hopeful of something of quality.Alas, "In Time" is not for the true Sci-Fi thinker. It paints a world in which time is money. That isn't that new an idea, but &&&Niccols$$$ does succeed in pushing the metaphor as a commodity. Those with time are rich, those without time are poor. It's a simplistic analogy. As with &&&Niccol's$$$ other films, the cinematography is beautiful. The best actors in the film aren't the main characters, rather &&&Cillian Murphy$$$, &&&Vincent Kartheiser$$$ and (surprisingly) &&&Alex Pettyfer$$$ present more interesting characters. They all shine, especially &&&Murphy$$$. The film seems like one long car chase, when what you actually want to delve into are the complexities - the debates between the characters themselves over the issues of the world they live in. Not a single clever conversation happens between anyone. &&&Murphy$$$ is a great actor and I would have been interested to see the debate about right and wrong become greyed through some thinking. Life is not black and white. The film ending is unrealistic and I wonder if this was the ending envisioned by &&&Niccol$$$ or the ending the producers wanted to boost sales. Sadly this film could have been a great deal more. It had a good topic. It had some great actors, yet it failed because the story lost the nuances and complexities to meet the lowest common denominator, rather than raising questions or making the viewer think critically. See it, but be prepared to be disappointed. It isn't subtle.
