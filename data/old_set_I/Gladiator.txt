 Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in &&&Ridley Scott's$$$ case, &&&Russel Crowe$$$ is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, &&&Crowe$$$ carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably &&&Connie Neilsen$$$, buoy the film to new perspectives.&&&Jacquin Phoenix$$$ definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. &&&Phoenix$$$ will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as &&&Maximusâ€™$$$ true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. &&&Scott's$$$ camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.&&&Crowe$$$ will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!
