Do <person>Guy Ritchie</person> and <person>Sherlock Holmes</person> fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic <person>Downey</person> Jr. and <person>Law</person> are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. <person>Downey</person> is <person>Holmes</person> and <person>Law</person> is sidekick Dr. <person>Watson</person>, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord <person>Blackwood</person> (a perfectly grave and menacing <person>Mark Strong</person>) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. <person>Rachel McAdams</person> also shows up as <person>Irene Adler</person>, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of <person>Holmes</person>.<person>Downey</person> Jr. brings quick-wit, cunning, and a scruffy toughness to a role long seen as stuffy and dry, while <person>Law</person> a distinguished charm that, at times, spills over into testy aggressiveness (which is funniest at <person>Holmes</person> most annoying). Both toss off the one-liners with ease. <person>Ritchie's</person> directorial style also comes through, from the dark, grimy Victorian- London production values to the violent boxing and martial arts matches. <person>Holmes'</person> mindset (such as the steps he takes to neutralize a suspect, interpret clues, follow the deceptive) also brings out <person>Ritchie's</person> ability to create an ultra-stylized flashback. There are also a few really thrilling action set-pieces involving a boat and an unfinished bridge. The plot, by three screenwriters, is a little on the convoluted side but it gets the job done with plot-twist on-top of plot twist. With all the brutal violence and style, you can be sure this isn't your Grandpa's <person>Sherlock Holmes</person>, but it will have you drooling for a sequel nonetheless.
