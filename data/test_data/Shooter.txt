I came into this film with loads of skepticism, but I came out feeling completely the opposite. Shooter takes you into the life of retired Marine Scout Sniper <person>Bob Lee Swagger</person>, who retired after a mission went completely wrong. He is called back to give information as to how someone would be able to kill the president from over a mile away. He ends up being framed for the attempted murder of the president, and the murder of an archbishop of Ethopia, and must prove his innocence, at any cost.<person>Mark Wahlberg</person> does a perfect job of portraying a detached veteran who has no respect for the government, and really brings the character to you. He is backed up by an outstanding <person>Michael Pena</person> and <person>Danny Glover</person> who add to the film like no one else could. The only real complaint is that <person>Kate Mara's</person> character, the widowed wife of <person>Swagger's</person> best friend seems to only play two emotions, distressed, or hysterical, and it does get annoying, though she plays the part well. <person>Elias Kosteas</person> did a good job playing <person>Jack Payne</person>, a borderline psychotic government agent, though at times his part seems over the top. All in all this film blew me away and I couldn't have loved it more. Anyone who is into action movies of any kind definitely needs to see this movie.
