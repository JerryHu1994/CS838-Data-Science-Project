I was wrong about <person>Ben Affleck</person>. I never believed that <person>Affleck</person> was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. <person>Ben Affleck</person> was truly incredible as <person>Doug McCray</person>, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.<person>Jeremy Renner</person> is quite intimidating and <person>Blake Lively</person> is sexy, <person>Ben Affleck</person> is gripping and the supporting cast is incredibly powerful. I think the movie was powerful and not at all predictable. I couldn't wait to see what would happen and if <person>Doug</person> would get away. It's such a greatly crafted movie. From writing to acting this film is wickedly astounding.I thought that the sex scene was over too quickly, but it was made up with all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the chase scenes. I thought the action sequences were well-drawn out. I loved the bank robbery scenes of the blue masks and the nun outfits. I especially liked <person>Ben's</person> scenes with the sledge hammer and the scene where he says, "if I think anything might happen to her, I'm gonna kill both of you." It's a clip from the trailer, but it's so much better when it happens in the film.It's driven as an action film with drama and romance on the side. There's a few chuckles along the way, but pretty much sparse. I thought the romance was done just enough and I felt the drama was perfectly done and drastically added to the plot, as well as the tone of the film.It's certainly the best heist movie I've ever seen. In comparison, if you called Inception a heist movie, this movie is a better heist movie. I really think this is the Heat of the decade. I truly believe that <person>Affleck</person> is in his peek of his career and this is his greatest performance, directing, writing and acting. I'm overjoyed and excited to see his next piece of work.
