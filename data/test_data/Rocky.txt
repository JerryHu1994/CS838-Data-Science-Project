"Your gonna eat lightning and your gonna crap thunder" Rocky is about a poor boxer living his life in Philadalphia. His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ <person>Apollo Creed</person> is given to him.Romance, Drama, Fight.Story- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. <person>Stallone</person> wrote it and fought to play <person>Rocky</person>. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 Music- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. <person>Bill Conti</person> gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous "gonna fly now". 10/10 Acting- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially <person>Burgess Meredith</person> who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. <person>Stallone</person> plays <person>Rocky Balboa</person> and changes his voice very well to be <person>Rocky</person>. He did a very good job. <person>Talia Shire</person> plays <person>Adrian</person>, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. <person>Burt Young</person> plays the drunkard <person>Paulie</person>. <person>Burgess Merideth</person> plays the boxing trainer <person>Mickey</person>. I have never seen a better performance. 9.5/10 <person>Stallone</person> fought for this triumphant movie that made me want to go the distance (sounds corny but its true). It made me strive to work harder and not give up. If you haven't seen this, buy it and watch it. I'll guarantee it will change you too. A classic.I give it a perfect 10/10
