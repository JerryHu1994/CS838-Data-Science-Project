In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop <person>Jake Hoyt</person> (<person>Hawk</person>) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer <person>Alonzo Harris</person> (<person>Washington</person>) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately <person>Hoyt</person> is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by <person>Alonzo's</person> nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where <person>Hoyt</person> tells <person>Harris</person> he will do "anything you want me to do", the situations <person>Hoyt</person> is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing <person>Hoyt</person> to decide which side <person>Harris</person> is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether <person>Hoyt</person> is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for <person>Harris</person> to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won <person>Denzel</person> the Oscar that year for Best Actor!! A must watch
