 <person>Steven Spielberg's</person> latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great <person>Stanley Kubrick</person>, has caused widely divergent comments.  And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see <person>Spielberg</person> crash, as he had with "1941" and HOOK.For my money, <person>Spielberg</person> has done it again with this futuristic science fiction drama, regardless of what the negative reviews say.  Its story of a robot boy (<person>Haley Joel Osment</person>) who desires to be a real boy in a far future in which humans (Orgas) and machines (Mechas) exist side-by-side but not always in harmony is very much modeled on the Pinocchio story, though it is actually based on a 1969 short story by <person>Brian Aldiss</person>.  It raises some interesting and sometimes unsettling moral dilemmas that few films of late have done.  Can a parent love a child, even if that child is not real?  What might happen if that child desired to be real?  How will Man and Machine be able to co-exist?Like all intelligent science fiction, such as <person>Kubrick's</person> own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and <person>Spielberg's</person> own CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, A.I. forces us to ponder where we've been and where we might be going.  It's an incredible combination of <person>Kubrick's</person> icy intellectual and clinical mind and <person>Spielberg's</person> emotional heart; and I think it works exceedingly well.  But it forces the viewer to not leave their heart and brains at the door, which I think is why it is being so negatively received in this season of mindless summer movie fare. It may be too intelligent for its own good, and many don't have the 145 minutes of patience needed for the movie.  I did, however; and I would call this an absolute masterpiece.  Out of ten stars, give this one a 10.
