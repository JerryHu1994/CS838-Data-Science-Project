 Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director <person>Martin Scorsese</person> spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang. It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage `Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic <person>Bill</person> terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody <person>Bill</person>. Amsterdam, however, has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass, all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots. <person>Daniel Day-Lewis</person> is marvelous as <person>Bill</person> the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore, moustache-twirling villain. <person>Day-Lewis</person> strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach <person>Day-Lewisâ€™</person> level is <person>Jim Broadbent</person> as <person>William 'Boss' Tweed</person>. <person>Broadbent</person> is <person>Tweed's</person> spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for <person>Tweed</person> against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though <person>Leonardo DiCaprio</person> is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his co-stars.  Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, <person>DiCaprio</person> is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young <person>James Cagney</person>, <person>DiCaprio's</person> acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as <person>Bill</person> or <person>Tweed</person> and, as good as <person>DiCaprio</person> is; <person>Day-Lewis</person> operates on a whole other level. <person>Cameron Diaz</person> as the beautiful pickpocket <person>Jenny</person>,  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time, <person>Diaz</person> fades into the background when compared to her more powerful co-stars. Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like lived-in clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862. <person>Scorsese</person> does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide, bold, exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement.
