 I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big &&&Robin Williams$$$ that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with &&&Paula Abdul$$$ as &&&Jasmine$$$ and &&&John De Lancie$$$ as &&&Jafar$$$. &&&Jasmine$$$ in this movie has the same sexual innocence as &&&Ariel$$$ the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially "Friend Like Me" and "A Whole New World." The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of &&&Robin Williams$$$ and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!
