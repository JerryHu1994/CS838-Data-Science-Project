First off, yes, much better than the first.... thank god, more locations, funnier and better put together.No time from opening credits, its straight into the action, which is more epic imo, and is what should have been seen in the first film but maybe due to a low budget we were subjected to a lesser affair The team work well, all of them and &&&Hemsworth$$$ does really well as the new boy on the block and second time round and you kind of know these guys. &&&Arnie$$$, &&&Bruce$$$ are seen more but are not seen as much as the usual gang, and li is seen the least.&&&Norris$$$ is great, seen here and there, great entrance and more of a cameo, and &&&Van Damme$$$ makes good his role as the villain.The story pretty much straight forward, better than the first, but nothing special, some dialogue was hard to hear, and sly does try to be serious in some scenes which got a laugh and I don't think its how it was intended but its not that much of a big deal really as there are funny moments in the film, more so than the first film.Fight scenes were better this time round, not too prolonged, timed well, and the one on ones didn't drag on too long. &&&Sly$$$ & &&&Van Damme's$$$ fight could have been a bit longer but I guess after all the chaos leading up to that point it was sufficient enough without getting too silly, reminded me of a Rocky fight here and there....he he One liners were good, dolph was great, the girl is good also, be good to see her in exp3, locations and sets fab, cgi was not obvious and edited well.One thing I will say is sly does have issues coming across as funny and I don't know why. He's funny in real life and was funny in rocky but its hit and miss and it shows here in some scenes.Its not 10/10 in my book. Maybe when i see it again it may be better in my mind, but like i say a better story would of helped If there is a 3rd, I would like to see more of a story if that is at all possible, see what you think guys when its out, but it's a big improvement on the first and that's a good sign
