National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular &&&Cage$$$ fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as &&&Ben Gates$$$ - slightly serious yet very witty! together with &&&Riley$$$, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.well done!
