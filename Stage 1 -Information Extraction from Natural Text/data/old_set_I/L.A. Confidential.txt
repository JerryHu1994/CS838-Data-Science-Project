 Six years ago, a director by the name of &&&Curtis Hansen$$$ came out with a small time film named L.A. Confidential. Though the movie garnered several big nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards, the nation had been swept up by the gigantic and romantic blockbuster, Titanic, thus shrinking the chances of this brilliant movie from garnering any real awards. 1997 completely screwed this phenomenal film, in which three brilliant actors gave the performances of their careers.&&&Russell Crowe$$$ plays Detective &&&Bud White$$$, a tough L.A. cop who bends the rules in order to bring justice to the city. He is ruthless, and unforgiving of anyone, which brings him into direct conflict with Detective Lieutenant &&&Ed Exley$$$, played by &&&Guy Pearce$$$. &&&Russell Crowe$$$ became with this role a full pledged character actor,: the cop with a steel physique, and a vulnerable heart. He becomes so believable and real to the audience, you can not help but sympathize for his character under the circumstances.  From this role, &&&Crowe$$$ went on to garner three best actor nominations, winning for his role in Gladiator.&&&Guy Pearce$$$, the little known Australian body builder, became the character known as &&&Ed Exley$$$, a straight, uptight detective trying to live up to the legend his father created before him. &&&Exley$$$ has so much to prove to the LAPD, trying to show them that he is just as good, maybe even better, than his father. He plays the politics in a corrupted police department very well, and is able to use these skills in solving the corrupt and mysterious case of the Night Owl murders. This film officially put &&&Guy Pearce$$$ in the big leagues of film, making his next appearances in Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. He is a severely underrated actor who deserves better than what he has been getting.Finally, the ever wonderful &&&Kevin Spacey$$$. &&&Spacey$$$ plays &&&Lieutenant Jack Vincenes$$$, a cop who gives a popular LA police show, Badge of Honor, real solved cases in return for money. &&&Jack$$$ sees his life as an ever going soap opera, until he comes across a case that somehow has a connection to the Night Owl murders. &&&Kevin Spacey$$$ has proved time and again his abilities as an actor, and he continues with this performance. &&&Curtis Hansen$$$ does a wonderful job bringing this story to the big screen. His talents, although recognized, have not been awarded as of yet. I can only hope that someday, someone will give this amazing director something worthy of his talents. Highly Recommended. MJR
