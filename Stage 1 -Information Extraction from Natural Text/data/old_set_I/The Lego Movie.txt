The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. The voice cast were excellent, especially &&&Liam Neeson's$$$ split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual &&&Liam Neeson$$$ tough guy. The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's "resistance piece". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels.
