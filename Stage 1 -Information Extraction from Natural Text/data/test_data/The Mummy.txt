 Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, <person>H. Rider Haggardesque</person> fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  <person>Karloff's</person> <person>Imhotep</person> only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  <person>Arnold Vosloo's</person> Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.<person>Brendan Fraser</person> looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that's pretty much all I'm looking for in a screen idol.  <person>John Hannah</person> was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  <person>Rachel Weisz</person> is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of "Heroine in an Adventure Film;"  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.OK, I lie.  The modern "Heroine in an Adventure Film" is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.And as to <person>Oded Fehr</person>, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy's tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.A couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?So if you're in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.Catmommie
