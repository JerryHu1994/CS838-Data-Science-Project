I know what you're expecting me to say. "If you liked Shrek ..." And it's so true. Fans of the first will be ga-ga over the second. The gang at Dreamworks was smart enough not to monkey around with a winning formula, so you have all the wit and charm of &&&Shrek$$$ (&&&Mike Myers$$$), &&&Fiona$$$ (&&&Cameron Diaz$$$), Donkey (&&&Eddie Murphy$$$), and all the fantastic fairy-tale creatures.At the beginning of 2, &&&Shrek$$$ and &&&Fiona$$$ have been invited by &&&Fiona's$$$ parents (&&&John Cleese$$$ and &&&Julie Andrews$$$) to the family castle. Imagine their surprise when the honeymooning ogres show up! Seems the king and queen haven't heard that a) &&&Fiona's$$$ an ogre and b) that her husband is one, too. Naturally, this doesn't sit particularly well with the king, and soon he's hired a hit man - Puss in Boots, no less, voiced by &&&Antonio Banderas$$$ - to bump off his new son in law. Meanwhile, a Fairy Godmother (&&&Jennifer Saunders$$$) offers help to &&&Fiona$$$. And quickly, the main question of the film - conveniently, it was the main question of the first film - is whether love conquers all. Oh, perhaps it's a bit more complex than that - perhaps it's whether &&&Fiona$$$ would love &&&Shrek$$$, no matter what he looked like. Come to think of it, that was the theme of the first one as well. &&&Shrek$$$ and &&&Fiona$$$ journey to the land of Far, Far Away, where the stuffy king and the queen mum live. Far, Far Away is a clear knockoff of Hollywood itself (complete with the sign on the mountain), and the journey includes a pass through what looks like Beverly Hills. The attention to detail is marvelous, as always.As with 1, 2 drops all sorts of &&&Disney$$$ references, most resulting in full-out belly laughter. I was in stitches, although perhaps - just perhaps - some of the humor will zoom over your tiny tot's tiny head.Shrek 2 is a beautifully done movie, perhaps even more entertaining than the original. Sure, at the end you know your emotions have been manipulated somewhat, but in the end you really don't care. Outstanding voice performances, flawless animation, and a crisp, moderately adult (but not mature, definitely not mature) script reign supreme.
