... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath.As a film it is superb. &&&McCarthy$$$ who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. &&&Ruffalo$$$ gives the performance of his career, &&&Keaton$$$ is solid as a rock, and &&&McAdams$$$ reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.A must-see.
