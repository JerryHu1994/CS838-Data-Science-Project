The Transporter (2002) was a fun action film that was directed by <person>Jet Li's</person> fight director <person>Corey Yuen</person> and it starred <person>Jason Statham</person>. <person>Jason</person> stars as <person>Frank Martin</person>. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named <person>Betancourt</person> (<person>Matt Schulze</person>). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. <person>Jason Statham</person> is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars <person>Shu Qi</person> (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).Highly recommended.
