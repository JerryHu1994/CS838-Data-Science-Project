This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand what people are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully. The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved <person>Russell</person> as <person>Javert</person>. He wasn't traditional by any means, but what he did worked. The cgi was not the best, but it kind of created this fantastical other world while still being realistic and grounded. So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For example <person>Jackman</person> ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging, which I thought was brilliant. There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However, I do see why a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't a lot of impressive violence, crazy camera shots, etc. the things critics seem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story, which it tells extremely well. The only thing I can point out (because I saw it with my boyfriend who knows nothing about the story) there are two or three slightly confusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But they are either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on. Anyways, that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many many times and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it even more.
