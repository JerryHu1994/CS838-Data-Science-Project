 Contrary to Pulp Fiction which had a very unusual editing and flashy  situations, <person>Jackie Brown</person> focuses more on characters that are basically  humans with very focused problems, for instance getting older which is an  eminent theme tackled in the film. No one's evil in all this. They all have  interestingly real personalities and I felt strangely comfortable watching  them talk, eat, kill and argue with each other. <person>Tarantino</person> is an excellent  storyteller and I wish I could write dialogues as interesting as his. The  film flows with a slower pace than Pulp, with all it's many streched takes  and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the  characters with all their differences. A more mature <person>Tarantino</person>. Still  loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: "This  one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera.  It's a character study."
