<person>Greg Focker</person> (<person>Ben Stiller</person>) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, <person>Pam</person> (<person>Teri Polo</person>) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first. During a weekend of getting to know them, he manages to make a strong impression; for all the wrong reasons. Her father (<person>Robert De Niro</person>) isn't quite what <person>Greg</person> has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.<person>De Niro</person> and <person>Stiller</person> play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss.8/10
