 This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon does just that, if you let it!
