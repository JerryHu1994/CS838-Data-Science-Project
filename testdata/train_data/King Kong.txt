Let me just say that with all of the remakes that have been coming out, King Kong may have been the most deserving and the most in need of being remade. I could not think of a better director for this type of film than <person>Peter Jackson</person>.King Kong stays pretty true to the original. <person>Naomi Watts</person> plays <person>Fay Wray's</person> <person>Ann Darrow</person> perfectly. Right down to her emotional connection with Kong, which is helped by the fact that Kong is pretty darn lovable when he is not ripping apart dinosaurs.<person>Adrien Brody</person> plays a great <person>Jack Driscoll</person> as well. <person>Brody</person> is truly a gifted actor and plays a good hero.Even <person>Jack Black</person> did a good job as the rebellious director <person>Carl Denham</person>. Usually I am annoyed by <person>Black's</person> performances, even though they are mostly in comedies. Surprisingly, <person>Black</person> kept his character serious and the movie is better for it. I though for sure he would be the one to ruin this movie for me but, again, I stand corrected. The comedy seemed to be reserved for <person>Kong</person>, himself, and did a wonderful job.I can not express how much more I enjoyed this movie without the "guy in the suit" special effects. <person>Kong</person> was very appealing visually, as well as the other dinosaurs. I do not say this too much in reviews. In fact, I doubt I have ever said it but King Kong has turned out to be a masterpiece which will raise the bar for many years to come. 10/10
