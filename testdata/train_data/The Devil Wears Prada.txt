Unmissable for <person>Meryl Streep</person> fans. She plays second fiddle to <person>Anne Hathaway</person> here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. <person>Meryl Streep</person> is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From <person>Sophie's</person> Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, <person>Meryl</person>/<person>Miranda</person> transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. <person>Emily Blunt</person> and <person>Stanley Tucci</person> are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. <person>Anne Hathaway</person> is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see <person>Meryl</person> be <person>Miranda</person>. You'll have a lot of fun.
