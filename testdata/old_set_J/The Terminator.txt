The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's &&&Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's$$$ career, made &&&James Cameron$$$ a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every "bad" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn't just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that &&&James Cameron$$$ had, he didn't have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity. One is heavily muscular; the other man, slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named "&&&Sarah Connor$$$", using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last &&&Sarah Connor$$$, he is stopped by the other man, &&&Kyle Reese$$$ who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage, &&&Reese$$$ explains that the man hunting &&&Sarah$$$ is actually a cyborg assassin called a "Terminator", built by Skynet, an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future, &&&Reese$$$ explains, Skynet gained self-awareness, initiated a global takeover of military hardware, and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. &&&John Connor$$$, &&&Sarah's$$$ son, rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign, the human resistance was on the verge of victory; in a last-ditch effort, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill &&&Sarah$$$ before &&&John$$$ was born, preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. &&&Reese$$$ volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect &&&Sarah$$$; after his use of the time transportation equipment, it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain, has no emotions, and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah, the effects are very 80's, but for the time and even to this day, I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything: action, romance, horror, sci-fi, and even some dark humor. The reason why &&&Arnold's$$$ "I'll be back" is so famous is not just because of his accent, but because you knew that something bad was coming. &&&Kyle Reese's$$$ "Come with me if you want to live" is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator, I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed, if you are, get a CAT scan.10/10
