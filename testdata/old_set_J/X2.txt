 Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hard-earned money to see X-Men 2. It was worth every penny.Firstly, the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The X-Men-with their forty years of history and continuity-are perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well, I've spoken to many hardcore X-fans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The X-Men and their enemy &&&Magneto$$$ have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years, I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.All the favourites are back including my personal favourite &&&Hugh Jackman$$$ as &&&Wolverine$$$ (I hope &&&Wolverine$$$ gets his own movie franchise one day). The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many X-Men (and women), the producers have to do the best they can; and they do indeed.There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies, the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore, the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics (and movies) have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as &&&Hitler's$$$ treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of &&&Martin Luthor King$$$ and &&&Malcom X$$$. In fact, many longtime X-fans have compared the X-Men's Professor &&&X$$$ to &&&Martin Luthor King$$$ and the evil &&&Magneto$$$ to &&&Malcom X$$$. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.This is the best superhero film since the 70's (when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie) and the 80's (when we saw &&&Tim Burton's$$$ Batman). It was a fantastic film but it begs one question-how are they ever going to top this?
