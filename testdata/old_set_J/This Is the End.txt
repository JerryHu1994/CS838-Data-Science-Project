If you've seen Superbad, Pineapple Express, etc., then you know the type of humor this movie will have. I, for one, could watch &&&James Franco$$$, &&&Seth Rogan$$$, and &&&Danny McBride$$$ leisurely eat a sandwich and manage to laugh my butt off. Thankfully this movie is much more exciting than that. It's brilliant that they all just play themselves and manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. Expect weed and drug humor of course. The plot sets itself up for hilarity, as they all take refuge in &&&James Franco's$$$ fortress of a mansion while the world outside them goes up in flames. Cabin fever mixed with dwindling supplies results in hilarious situations and good one liners. The movie made me laugh extremely hard and had all my favorite people in one film. I only wouldn't recommend this film if you're uptight and religious.
