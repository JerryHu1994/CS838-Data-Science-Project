First of all i would like to ask how any of the other reviewers could possibly give this film 1 out of 10? They must have some deep rooted personal reasons for this i guess.I nearly didn't watch this film for all of the negative reviews. I would have so missed out on something good.The film was excellent! Great plot. Creepy bad guy and a reasonable amount of suspense. I have never read the &&&Jack Reacher$$$ books, so cannot compare &&&Cruise$$$ to the title character. I imagine that some people might have been disappointed at the lack of huge explosions and transforming robots etc etc, but this was a fine old school action thriller with many new tricks which i haven't seen before (check the buss stop scene. Classic!). I loved the pacing and the great interaction between players. Sure, some of the one liners seemed a tad forced, but they were not so common. Well done &&&Cruise$$$ again.Do yourselves a favour. Ignore the negative reviewers and give this a go.
