I find it very amusing to read all the reviews here. I mostly agree with all the ones who found it disappointing, I can see why the &&&Michael Bay$$$ loving GTA-generation could give this a '10', however: Lots of CGI, fake green-screen action and style over substance.For me - a die hard &&&Indiana Jones$$$ fan, who grown up attending premieres for the first three - this was a big letdown, primarily because of the script, which could have been written by a 11 year-old. A lot of &&&Indiana Jones$$$ fans all over the world are probably scratching their heads these days, wondering why a script (Darabonts) which &&&Spielberg$$$ called "the best he has read since Raiders", was scrapped by &&&Lucas$$$. So he could give us this? &&&Tarzan$$$ meets X-files?It just didn't rock my boat, like the first three. I even found 'National Treasure II' more entertaining, than this mess.
