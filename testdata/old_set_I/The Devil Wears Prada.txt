Unmissable for &&&Meryl Streep$$$ fans. She plays second fiddle to &&&Anne Hathaway$$$ here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. &&&Meryl Streep$$$ is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From &&&Sophie's$$$ Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, &&&Meryl$$$/&&&Miranda$$$ transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. &&&Emily Blunt$$$ and &&&Stanley Tucci$$$ are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. &&&Anne Hathaway$$$ is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see &&&Meryl$$$ be &&&Miranda$$$. You'll have a lot of fun.
