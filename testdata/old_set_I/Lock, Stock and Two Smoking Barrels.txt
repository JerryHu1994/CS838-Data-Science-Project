 I was a total and complete sucker for this film.If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn't change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue ("It's been emotional.")Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and &&&Ritchie$$$ isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at "realism" - &&&Ritchie$$$ doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be "spiritually enriching" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like &&&Quentin Tarantino$$$ films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.Can't recommend it enough.
