Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. &&&Roger Ebert$$$ can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (&&&Hilary Swank$$$) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (&&&Clint Eastwood$$$) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (&&&Morgan Freemna$$$) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. &&&Eastwood$$$ and &&&Freeman$$$ are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant &&&Swank$$$, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was.
