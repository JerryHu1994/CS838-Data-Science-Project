Gone Girl marks &&&Fincher's$$$ tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on &&&Nick Dunne$$$, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring &&&Ben Affleck$$$, &&&Rosamund Pike$$$, &&&Tyler Perry$$$ and &&&Neil Patrick Harris$$$, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. &&&Gillian Flynn$$$ does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. &&&Ben Affleck$$$ and &&&Rosamund Pike$$$ are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different &&&Affleck$$$, a very human and realized &&&Affleck$$$. &&&Nick Dunne$$$ is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. &&&Harris$$$ and &&&Perry$$$ give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to &&&Affleck$$$ and &&&Pike$$$. &&&David Fincher$$$ and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, &&&Jeff Cronenweth$$$ create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the scoreâ€¦&&&Trent Reznor$$$ and &&&Atticus Finch$$$ deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If &&&Reznor$$$ won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.
