I can gladly say that &&&David Ayer's$$$ World War II flick 'Fury' lived up to my expectations. The audience are confronted with the horrors of war, accompanied with some truly spectacular well-crafted battle scenes that proves &&&Ayer's$$$ desire to create something new and profound. &&&Ayer$$$ keeps the gritty realism he employed on his other acclaimed films only this time uses it to depict the journey of a tank crew in Germany in 1945. The performances are strong from &&&Brad Pitt$$$, &&&Logan Lerman$$$ and even &&&Shia LaBeouf$$$ has proved he has a hidden acting talent after his heyday on the set of 'Transformers'. An emotional war-drama that packs a punch with visceral action scenes and an atmospheric score, definitely worth a watch.
