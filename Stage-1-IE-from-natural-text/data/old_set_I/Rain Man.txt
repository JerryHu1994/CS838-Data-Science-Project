 I have seen this movie probably 7 or 8 times in the past three years, wrote a paper about it for my college film class last semester, and basically regard it as my favorite movie of all time.  Where to begin with the praise for this movie?  Let's start with the acting.  &&&Dustin Hoffman$$$ is my favorite actor, and has been for a while.  I'd watch him in any role.  I was amazed at the way he was able to pull off this role.  I've never seen a more deserved Oscar win.  The vacant stare, the monotone voice, the screaming, it was unbelievable.  Each time I watch it I am floored by his talent.  &&&Tom Cruise$$$ is also good, the villain of the story who undergoes such a subtle change that it's almost not visible until nearly the end.  He is, however, perfectly suited for the flashy, egotistical character of &&&Charlie$$$, and I think he did a great job.  The directing was unobtrusive and beautiful, for the most part just letting the action unfold, which is exactly the way it should have been done.  It's a feel-good movie that does that and more, and I think nothing I've seen in the movies is as touching as the scene in the motel where &&&Charlie$$$ discovers who "Rain Man" really is.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.  Absolutely wonderful.
