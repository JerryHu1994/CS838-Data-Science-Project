&&&Greg Focker$$$ (&&&Ben Stiller$$$) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, &&&Pam$$$ (&&&Teri Polo$$$) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first. During a weekend of getting to know them, he manages to make a strong impression; for all the wrong reasons. Her father (&&&Robert De Niro$$$) isn't quite what &&&Greg$$$ has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.&&&De Niro$$$ and &&&Stiller$$$ play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss.8/10
