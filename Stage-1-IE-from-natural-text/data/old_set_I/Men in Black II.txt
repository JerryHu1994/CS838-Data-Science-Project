Let me just start by saying that I normally like movies with &&&Tommy Lee Jones$$$ and / or &&&Will Smith$$$ in them. They certainly don't belong to the enormous group of average and unnoticeable actors, but have some kind of style and presence that I really can appreciate. But I'm afraid that's about the best thing I can say about them right now, because what they did in this movie was nothing but a hasty 'grab-as-much-money-as-you-can' job and I really don't like to see that."Men in Black II" starts four years later from where the first one ended. &&&Kay$$$ has given up life as an agent and has returned to civilian life, working in a postal office, while &&&Jay$$$ has continued to work for the 'Men in Black'. While investigating what seems to be a routine crime, &&&Jay$$$ uncovers a diabolical plot masterminded by &&&Serleena$$$, an evil &&&Kylothian$$$ monster who disguises herself as a sexy lingerie model. With their headquarters under siege and time running out, &&&Jay$$$ must convince &&&Kay$$$, who no longer remembers anything of his time with the MIB, to rejoin the agency so they can save the Earth from being destroyed completely.I admit that some of the special effects were nice to watch, but even that didn't always convince me. Some of the aliens were small masterpieces, others however seemed like a hasty job, unfinished by the people of the computer graphics department. The only possible explanation for that might be that they wanted to save enough money so the profit rate would be even larger. And the computer animations weren't the only one to suffer from that problem. The script writers didn't come up with any new things either. All they did was to repeat what worked in the first movie. It even seems like they didn't have the time to come up with a new and decent plot.And yet not everything was that bad. The humor for instance worked, not always perfectly but it worked. Jokes like "It came with a black dude, but it kept being pulled over" when they talk about the automatic pilot in the Mercedes were funny. I even liked that dog singing on the front seat of the car, but overall it just wasn't enough to save the entire movie. No, if you are looking for a spectacular new movie that is full of great acting, a great story and some excellent computer animations, than you'll be very disappointed by this one. It just seems like they threw it together in a couple of weeks and that's why I can only give it a 6/10.
