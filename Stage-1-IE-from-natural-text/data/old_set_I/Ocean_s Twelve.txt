Three years ago &&&Danny Ocean$$$ (&&&Clooney$$$) and his team stole 160 million dollars from &&&Terry Benedict$$$ (&&&Garcia$$$). Now &&&Benedict$$$ wants his money back. Plus interest. Thus &&&Ocean$$$ and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, &&&Rusty Ryan$$$ (&&&Pitt$$$) has an ex-love (&&&Zeta-Jones$$$) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But &&&Benedict$$$ and sexy cop &&&Isabel Lahiri$$$ (&&&Zeta-Jones$$$) aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of "nightfox" ( &&&Vincent Cassel$$$) is keen to battle it out with &&&Ocean$$$ and his team; to decide who the best thief (or thieves) are. And there you have Ocean's 12; a film which falls too short in terms of wit, appearance, plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.One thing must be made clear, however; the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone; even &&&Catherina Zeta-Jones$$$, newcomer to the &&&Soderbergh$$$ film. And it is indeed very rare to jam-pack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them; &&&Julia Roberts$$$, &&&George Clooney$$$, &&&Brad Pitt$$$, &&&Matt Damon$$$, &&&Catherina Zeta Jones$$$, &&&Bernie Mac$$$, &&&Andy Garcia$$$, &&&Don Cheadle$$$ … just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11, you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately, the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....If you were like me, absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film, then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots, every single take, camera angles were all very clean-cut, solid and very stylish. In this film however, &&&Soderbergh$$$ decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film, unlike the first one, the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet &&&Benedict's$$$ deadline and I suppose &&&Soderbergh$$$ wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy, bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies; it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.Secondly, the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quick-wit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for &&&Clooney$$$; "Do i look 50?". The plot is predictable; from &&&Julia Robert's$$$ 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing; past tense (there's that shaky cam again!). I cant give too much away but my personal opinion is that the explanation of how the team pulled of the robbery is a little confusing and a sort of "huh"? moment which you will need to disucss with other's who have seen the film, to make sure you absolutely understood everything.All in all the film is a let down. By all means go and see it; if for no other reason than to drool over the gorgeous &&&Matt Damon$$$, &&&Brad Pitt$$$ and &&&George Clooney$$$…. But do not get your hopes up. As the credits roll you will find yourself feeling cheated somehow. Ocean's 11 was a real gem but Ocean's 12 just leaves you pining for the original.... 5.5/10
