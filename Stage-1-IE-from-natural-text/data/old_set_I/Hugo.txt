Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. &&&James Cameron$$$ who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of &&&Scorsese's$$$ films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. &&&Sasha Baron Cohen$$$ is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.
