The basic storyline of 50 First Dates: &&&Henry Roth$$$ lives in Hawaii and spend his time wooing women who are visiting the island, simply because there is little chance of commitment. Then he meets &&&Lucy Whitmore$$$. One day they hit it off, and the next she doesn't even recognise him. It turns out that she suffers from short-term memory loss, and every day he tries to win her over once more. Firstly, I have to say that 50 First Dates is a really funny film. It isn't overly stupid, but it's not subtle either. But underneath the humour is where I believe this film's true beauty lies. It shows love in a way that I have never seen in another film before. From the way that her family sacrifices everything to keep her happy, and blissfully unaware of her condition, to &&&Henry$$$ who, despite the fact that he could have just about any woman that he wanted, decides that he wants to be with &&&Lucy$$$, regardless of the fact that he has to meet her for the first time every day. &&&Henry's$$$ character undergoes somewhat of a transformation in front of our eyes. The film starts off with him coming across as somewhat of a pig (well, to us women anyway :)), and by the end of the film, we truly admire him. He even sacrifices his dream so that he can be with &&&Lucy$$$, and help her to move on with her life. The film isn't really predictable, either. For example, I spent the entire films assuming that the ending would be somewhat different. Although romcoms almost always have happy endings, this one damn near had me in tears. And it wasn't even sad. I never knew what a feel-good film was until I saw this...highly recommended.
