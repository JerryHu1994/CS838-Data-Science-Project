I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like &&&Tom Hanks$$$ in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  &&&Robert Langdon$$$ should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to &&&Hanks$$$ occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - &&&Paul  Bettany$$$ is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  &&&Silas$$$ to utter perfection. &&&Sir Ian McKellan$$$ too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  &&&Audrey Tautou$$$ is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played &&&Bezu Fache$$$ - &&&Jean Reno$$$ was made for the role.As you'd expect from a &&&Ron Howard$$$ Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. &&&Langdon's$$$ "Godspeed" caused me to  awake in the night sweating! I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation.
