Honestly I was very interested in watching this movie when I saw the trailer however almost 45 min into it I hadn't even cracked a smile. I expected a lot more from this film, especially being a big fan of &&&Seth$$$ and &&&Franco$$$. This movie has a few puns here an there but overall a terrible movie, expect garbage. If it hadn't been for all the controversy surrounded around it I'm sure it would've gotten mediocre reviews all around. I honestly don't understand the 9+ stars from some reviewers, it's satire but not comedically well written in any sense. Save yourself the trouble, don't bother watching it. &&&Seth$$$ and &&&Franco$$$ gave a good performance but the movie had a lame plot and subpar lines.
