 This is the movie that started it all. I'm not talking about the Hollywood  blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood  Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my  interest in movies. This is the movie that did it.   I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember  this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went  to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my  friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it  to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real  interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe  &&&Spielberg$$$, &&&Benchley$$$, &&&Scheider$$$, &&&Shaw$$$, &&&Dreyfuss$$$, &&&Williams$$$, &&&Fields$$$ and  everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you.   I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that  much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say  it is an obsession. A sick obsession.   The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the  shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we  care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close,  but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so  effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting  score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping  suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other  movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing.   And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not  top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is  that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs,  and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you  think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to  kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water?  I can't. And &&&Martin Brody$$$ sure can't.   And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100  greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for  that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine.   &&&Steven$$$, &&&Peter$$$, &&&Roy$$$, &&&Robert$$$, &&&Richard$$$, &&&John$$$, and &&&Verna$$$ -- thank you. Not for  just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want  to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as  much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first  time.
