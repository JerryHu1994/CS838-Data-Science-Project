8/10.I know a lot of the other reviewers will compare this film to the older one and also the book, so if you're interested in a comparison, stop reading here. I want to review this film as a movie that tells a story, like every other film. I don't want to review this as a film that tried to beat its preceding film adaptation. I myself have read the book and have always been so intrigued with the character of &&&Gatsby$$$, and when I heard a few years back that he would be portrayed on the big screen by &&&DiCaprio$$$, I couldn't wait. The character carries such a mystery about him that was delivered so excellently by &&&Leonardo DiCaprio$$$, and made it so fun to watch. It was almost like I didn't know what the ending was because I was so immersed in 1920s New York, and in the lifestyle of &&&The Great Gatsby$$$. The film itself, as a film, was awesome! The visuals and soundtrack were captivating and lavish. The acting was great overall, as you can trust these actors to deliver.I read somewhere on IMDb (message board or another reviewer, I can't remember) that Leonardo wasn't a good fit for the role of &&&Gatsby$$$. I think this statement couldn't be more wrong. If you have read the book, you must have some idea about the depth of &&Gatsby's character$$$, the depth of his mind, his desires. The false smiles, the phony handshakes, the uneasiness in being in public, the way &&&Jay Gatsby$$$ conducts himself in front of &&&Daisy$$$, and in pursuit of her. All these things are delivered so well by &&&DiCaprio$$$. His nerve, his frustration, his determination...all so eloquently portrayed. But most of all, his passion, and as &&&Nick Carraway$$$, our narrator so emphatically reminds us, his hope. The character development of &&&Jay Gatsby$$$, and the development of all those surrounding him gives us such a deep look at the relationships of such a diverse category of people.The storyline is obviously interesting: A man realizes his new neighbor is a mysterious, and incredibly wealthy man. Like how awesome is that? Throughout the whole film, as the relationships between all the few main characters become deeper and deeper, and the questions become answered, you just can't help but feel so into the characters' lives. Great writing for the characters, great directing, great great great acting. Overall, this is just a great film. If you go into the theater thinking "oh this'll suck compared to &&&Robert Redford$$$" or "I bet the book is way better", you're setting yourself up for a bad 143 minutes. Don't be so close minded and try to view it as just another film that tells a fictional story, and a great one at that.
