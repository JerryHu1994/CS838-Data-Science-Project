 Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I have watched it at least ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. &&&Martin Scorsese$$$ is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer &&&Jake LaMotta$$$ watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as &&&Deniro$$$ (in what may be his best performance) and &&&Scorsese$$$ unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. &&&Thelma Schoonmaker's$$$ jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story. If there is a more perfect exploration of why as men we act the way we do, then I'd love to see it, because this movie made me re-evaluate my life. 10/10
