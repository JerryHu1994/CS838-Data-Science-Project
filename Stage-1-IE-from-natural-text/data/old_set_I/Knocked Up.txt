&&&Ben Stone$$$ (&&&Seth Rogen$$$) meets &&&Alison Scott$$$ (&&&Katherine Heigl$$$) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, &&&Alison$$$ discovers she's pregnant and &&&Ben$$$ is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.&&&Seth Rogen$$$ does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And &&&Katherine Heigl$$$ is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. &&&Leslie Mann$$$ and &&&Paul Rudd$$$ are perfect together. And I think &&&Kristen Wiig$$$ steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs.
