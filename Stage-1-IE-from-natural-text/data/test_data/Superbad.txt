I got to see an advanced screening the other night, complete with an interview with the cast. I figured this movie could go either way, especially when you consider "40 year-old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" were funny and entertaining, but they weren't exactly loved by all.I am happy to say this movie was wonderful. The jokes are crude, but dead on, and unlike recent movies with a similar style, like "Clerks 2," the plot moves on without any real downtime (you know, where the plot slows the progress of humor and you find yourself checking your watch). <person>Jonah Hill</person> and <person>Michael Cera</person> have that best friend chemistry that this movie required as well as being dead on with their jokes. The real star of the movie, however, was newcomer <person>Christopher Mintz-Plasse</person>, who took the role of <person>Fogell</person> and OWNED it. I got the chance to chat with the actors and I was not only surprised to hear that both <person>Mintz-Plasse</person> and <person>Michael Cera</person> are 18 and 19 respectively.For the type of movie this is and the brilliant script that <person>Seth Brogen</person> has presented, there is no reason why anyone, young or old, can't relate to this off-the-wall comedy. See this movie!
