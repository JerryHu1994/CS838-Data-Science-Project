 I've seen TOTAL RECALL many times over the years and I'm never failed to be impressed with it . Some people dislike it and I feel I must defend the movie " Confused plot " - Sorry but I managed to understand the complex plot first time I saw the movie and was impressed that Hollywood had merged a high concept plot with a FX laden extravaganza , such a pity this didn't lead to more thoughtful action adventures . If you want to see a confused plot try watching a <person>James Bond</person> movie from the 1980s " The violence " - Yeah this is a violent movie for sure but I do wish people would educate themselves to the work of directors before they criticize . <person>Paul Verhoeven</person> had previously made FLESH AND BLOOD and ROBOCOP so a futuristic adventure by <person>Verhoeven</person> that was awarded an 18 certificate isn't going to be confused with an episode of the teletubbiesWhat I liked from <person>Verhoeven's</person> directing is that he's made everything so recognizable , nothing is ridiculously futuristic looking and we see the characters wearing clothes that wouldn't look out of place in the 1980s . <person>Verhoeven</person> also brings little satirical stabs to the proceedings as he did with ROBOCOP and it's a great shame we see less and less of this European director working for Hollywood <person>Verhoeven</person> even gets a good performance from <person>Big Arnie</person> , okay this body builder was never in danger of winning an Oscar but <person>Arnie</person> doesn't send himself up and nor do his wise cracks like in his other blockbusters but he does make for an affable - Though violent - hero . <person>Michael Ironside</person> gives the most memorable performance which considering he spends most of the movie running around with a gun is no small achievement . One interesting thing I noticed about TOTAL RECALL after seeing it again last night is that it's unapologetic on being on the side of the rebels who are waging a war against the greedy Mars company . Anyone believe that if it was made today the rebels/terrorists would be the bad guys ? Anyway this is along with the original TERMINATOR the best movie starring <person>Arnie</person> though most of the credit for this movie belongs to the screenwriters and director and it's a great pity Hollywood is reluctant to mix a high concept SF plot with a crowd pleasing action adventure
