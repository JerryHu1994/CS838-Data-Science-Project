We watched ' Star Trek - Into the Darkness this afternoon (May 9th 2013).I am not going to reveal specific details because this film is so new that I am aware that many people still have not had the opportunity to watch it, and I do not wish to ruin their experience.Having read the points raised in the 'maddog' review I just wanted to say that we found it to be a truly absorbing and brilliant film, and our views are so diametrically opposed to 'maddog' that I genuinely wonder if he/or she actually watched the same film - or slept through it and took a wild guess as to its quality.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is mainly a fast paced action film interspersed with scenes of human interest which facilitates the deeper development of the main characters and their inter-relationships. The phrase 'bonding under fire seems appropriate.I would urge people not to be dissuaded from watching this film because a reviewer cannot see the link between <person>Gene Roddenberry's</person> much vaunted ideals and therefore trashes <person>J.J. Abrams</person> work. Let me just say that as I am in my 66th year, I have watched ALL the Star Trek series and films and can advise that this film combines a serious reflection of <person>William Shatner's</person> portrayal of <person>James T. Kirk</person> but also matures <person>Chris Pine</person> as the film progresses. As <person>Roddenberry</person> was closely involved with original Star Trek series I therefore believe that he would approve the direction that <person>Abrams</person> is taking the latest incarnation of Star Trek.Star Trek - Into the Darkness is aptly named. It is rich in plot detail and exciting to watch. It will have many people sitting on the edge of their seats, willing those embroiled in battle to succeed. Even the villain (stunningly portrayed by <person>Benedict Cumberpatch</person>) warrants a certain amount of sympathy from all fair minded people.My advice - Go, Watch - and be thrilled by a brilliant film. We will go and see it again!!Our thanks to all those involved in bringing this to our screen - great job!
