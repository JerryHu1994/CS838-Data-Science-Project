What a wonderful accomplishment of a film by <person>James Marsh</person> (Man on Wire) who brings such depth and beauty to the life/love story of <person>Stephen</person> and <person>Jane Hawking</person>. The film is adapted from her novel on their life and brings forth much of the love and tenacity necessary to care for and love someone going through great physical struggles over time. <person>Eddie Redmayne</person> and <person>Felicity Jones</person> give fantastic and intimate portrayals of <person>Stephen</person> and <person>Jane</person> during their courtship and lives together. My vote for best film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. In Q&A after film <person>James Marsh</person> told a great story about <person>Stephen Hawking's</person> reaction to the film where he gave the response that it was in "largely genuine"... and <person>Eddie Redmayne</person> said that <person>Stephen Hawking</person> after viewing the film allowed them to use his actual "voice" instead of their approximation for the film that they had produced. The most touching was that <person>Hawking</person> had tears to be wiped away after viewing which will give to you a sense of how genuine this film is.
