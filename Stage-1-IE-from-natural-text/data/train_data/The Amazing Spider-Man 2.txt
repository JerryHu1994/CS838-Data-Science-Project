I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two <person>Raimi</person> films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed <person>Andrew Garfield's</person> Spider-Man but his <person>Peter Parker</person> didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (<person>Gwen</person> instead of <person>Mary Jane</person>, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.I do research on films that I'm excited for. This film came out weeks earlier in the UK and Europe. And the reviews were mixed which was sinking my high hopes. I didn't like the fact that there were three villains (More on that later). But it seemed like they were choosing the right actors for parts and surrounding the film in talent. After much heart and headache reading people thoughts and reviews for me, I'm okay with saying I liked much of this second Spider-Man film.<person>Andrew Garfield</person> is Spider-Man and it seems he's embraced the part much more this time than in the first film. His Spider-Man is having fun being the savior of the city. He's making the quips, the jokes and the all around energy of his Spider-Man feels directly out of the comic book. I am finally sold on his <person>Peter Parker</person>. Director <person>Marc Webb</person> finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging.I'm still not an <person>Emma Stone</person> fan but she is a good counter to <person>Garfield's</person> <person>Parker</person>. They have excellent chemistry. You can tell that these may be <person>Webb's</person> favorite scenes to shoot. When they are on screen this huge summer tent pole film because a small drama about two people with a unique love story. The villains, there are three of them but not really. Let me explain. <person>Rhino</person> played basically as a cameo by <person>Paul Giamatti</person> is really only on screen to show Spider-Man in action at the beginning and end of the film. His main adversaries are <person>Jamie Foxx's</person> Electro who starts off as a man who is saved by Spider-Man. He then becomes a obsessed fan only to in perfect comic book fashion have a horrible accident that grants him superpowers. <person>Foxx</person> is okay, I wouldn't say he is awful. He has some good moments and contrary to what has been written I think he only has one cringe worthy line.<person>Dane DeHaan</person> is one of if not my favorite actor working this moment. His method style works so well in many of the films he's in and here it's perfect. His <person>Harry Osborn</person> is less cartoon-y than <person>James Franco's</person> from previous films. He's creepy, spoiled, arrogant but dealt with a lot of adversity. His chemistry with <person>Garfield</person> feels genuine. It doesn't feel forced like it could have been. They are long time friends who have been distant but because of new circumstances are forced back together.The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense was very cool. I want to see more of that. The small nods to the comic book are fantastic. There are nods here and there to the upcoming sinister six film which doesn't cloud the film. It's just there in the story that this is apart of a large story in the future. I was trying to count the nods to the comic books. The only issues I had with the film was <person>Peter's</person> search for what happen to his father was kind of just there to fill time. Also the great <person>Sally Field</person> as Aunt <person>May</person> got only a few scenes. She was great on screen but mostly wasted.Because this film is dividing fans I think I've pinpointed the problem. I'm a fan of the comic books and this film feel like a few issues of the comic books aka a mini-series. There are multiple stories, with multiple villains and a lot going on. I'm okay with the finally product and eager to see the film again. For <person>Garfield's</person> performance, the chemistry with Stone and the action scenes this film is a fun ride for any fan of the neighborhood web shooter.
