 This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast <person>James Earl Jones</person>, <person>Jeremy Irons</person>, <person>Whoopi Goldberg</person>. This is a standout.
