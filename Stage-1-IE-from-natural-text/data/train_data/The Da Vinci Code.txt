I can't say I was blown away by The Da Vinci Code - as is often the  case, the book was far superior. I generally like <person>Tom Hanks</person> in almost  all his roles, however I found that I had such a pre-conception of what  <person>Robert Langdon</person> should be, that it took me about half an hour to get  used to <person>Hanks</person> occupying this character. Once I settled into it  though - it was a thoroughly enjoyable, occasionally slow moving  thriller. Having read the book, I did have a knowledge of the various  groups and factions involved - I'm not sure how someone who hasn't read  the book will fair though.The casting of the movie is surely one of it's stronger points - <person>Paul  Bettany</person> is almost unrecognisable and plays the menacing single minded  <person>Silas</person> to utter perfection. <person>Sir Ian McKellan</person> too, it totally fantastic,  and really steals most scene's he appears in. He delivers some great  one liners too - a real character actor playing a real character.  <person>Audrey Tautou</person> is as we have come to expect, just lovely, and who else  could have played <person>Bezu Fache</person> - <person>Jean Reno</person> was made for the role.As you'd expect from a <person>Ron Howard</person> Production, there is a good amount of  cheese, especially towards the end. <person>Langdon's</person> "Godspeed" caused me to  awake in the night sweating! I am a fairly harsh marker on the IMDb, so don't be put off by a 6 out  of 10 - I did enjoy the movie, but my anticipation was so great with  this film, that it could never live up to my expectation.
