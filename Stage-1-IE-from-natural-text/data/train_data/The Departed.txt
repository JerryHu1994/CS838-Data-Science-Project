Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for <person>Martin Scorsese</person>, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, <person>William Monahan</person>, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and <person>Scorsese's</person>, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even <person>Leo</person>, for all you <person>DiCaprio</person> bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) <person>Scorsese's</person> long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like <person>Martin Sheen</person> and <person>Alec Baldwin</person> playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.
