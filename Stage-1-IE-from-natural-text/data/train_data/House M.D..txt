Great show, despite what others say, especially if a show like ER doesn't appeal to you. House is a unique character to be appreciated among the saps of TV nowadays.I must say something to <person>Hugh Laurie</person>. People complain about his accent. He's English playing an American. I lived in England for a year on exchange. I'm an American. Though I'm no expert on accents, I have to say I didn't notice that <person>Hugh Laurie</person> had any sort of English accent. A slight accent can show if you're really looking for it, but, other than that, he's version of an American accent is great.House is a great show, but it's not for the weak of heart or weak of stomach. It's not like ER at all. House is like the <person>Sherlock Holmes</person> of medicine. It's a drama without the screaming and tears.Sorry if this is a horrible comment, but it's my first review on IMDb of a show :)
