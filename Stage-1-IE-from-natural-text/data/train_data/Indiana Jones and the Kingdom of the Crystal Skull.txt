I find it very amusing to read all the reviews here. I mostly agree with all the ones who found it disappointing, I can see why the <person>Michael Bay</person> loving GTA-generation could give this a '10', however: Lots of CGI, fake green-screen action and style over substance.For me - a die hard <person>Indiana Jones</person> fan, who grown up attending premieres for the first three - this was a big letdown, primarily because of the script, which could have been written by a 11 year-old. A lot of <person>Indiana Jones</person> fans all over the world are probably scratching their heads these days, wondering why a script (Darabonts) which <person>Spielberg</person> called "the best he has read since Raiders", was scrapped by <person>Lucas</person>. So he could give us this? <person>Tarzan</person> meets X-files?It just didn't rock my boat, like the first three. I even found 'National Treasure II' more entertaining, than this mess.
