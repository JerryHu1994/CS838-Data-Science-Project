I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire. Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by <person>Tom Hanks</person> and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too.It's a movie, not a documentary. And it's a great movie, a classic by all means.
