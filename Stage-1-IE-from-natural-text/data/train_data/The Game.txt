Whether you love it or hate it, The Game definitely will not bore you.  By far the most engrossing movie I've ever watched.  I saw this on the big screen and throughout most of this masterpiece I kept asking myself, "where is this movie going?"  For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires.  <person>Michael Douglas</person> is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly.  I love this movie, it's definitely one of my personal favorites.
