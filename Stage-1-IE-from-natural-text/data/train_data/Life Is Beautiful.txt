I can't understand how other reviewers see this as a film about the Nazis or the Holocaust. It's not!!! "Life is Beautiful" is a film about love, optimism, courage and inner strength.To be honest I can't get this film out of my thoughts and decided to write this brief review in the hope that I could move on."Life is Beautiful" is an unforgettable film. You go through emotions you were surprised could have for a fictional film. The story, although totally implausible, is uplifting and depressing at the same time.Please see it for yourself. Have a box of tissues handy.Best film ever seen!!!
