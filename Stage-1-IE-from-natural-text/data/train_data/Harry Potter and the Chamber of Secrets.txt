 If you liked the first one then you're going to love this!  There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including <person>Gilderoy Lockhart</person> (hilariously played by <person>Kenneth Branagh</person>), <person>Draco Malfoy's</person> father, <person>Lucius</person> (a great performance by <person>Jason Isaacs</person>, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), <person>Ron's</person> father, <person>Arthur</person>, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)The movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between <person>Harry</person> and Professor <person>Snape</person> (who was seriously underused in this movie!)All in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it.  By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat...
