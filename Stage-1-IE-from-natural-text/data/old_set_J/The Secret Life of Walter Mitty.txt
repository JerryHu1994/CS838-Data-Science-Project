I expected this to be funny and perhaps a little goofy. What it is is a breathtaking work of art. This is &&&Ben Stiller$$$ at his best. The movie is just wonderful. It's funny, thought provoking, touching at times and startling at others. It's entertaining throughout. The pace may seem slow at times to those used to action packed films, but I personally don't care for nonstop technically enhanced action scenes for no apparent reason. I've been hoping people would tire of those for some time now, so we can get back to good stories again. This was a great story, loosely based on the original short story by &&&James Thurber$$$. I wish there were more movies out there like this. That would definitely get me back into movie theaters. As well...the acting was superb all around. &&&Kristen Wiig$$$ was outstanding--as usual. I think this may be her best work as well.
