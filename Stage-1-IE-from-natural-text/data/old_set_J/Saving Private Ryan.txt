 To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director
&&&Steven Spielberg$$$ uses all of his talent and resources to give to the
world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the
type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the
emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the
fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and
unpredictable.&&& Spielberg$$$ is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is &&&Tom Hanks$$$' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and &&&Forrest Gump$$$ (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. &&&John Miller$$$, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private &&&Ryan$$$ is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in.
