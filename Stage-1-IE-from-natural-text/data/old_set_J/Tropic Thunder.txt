'Tropic Thunder' is the sharpest, nastiest, and most honest parody of Hollywood since &&&Altman's$$$ 'The Player'.If &&&Doweny$$$ Jr. in black face, the script's use of "retard", or the politically incorrect humor offends you, you're missing the point.Only &&&Russel Crowe$$$, &&&Robin Williams$$$, and &&&Harvey Weinstein$$$ should take offense. The parodies of their personalities, their films, and their business tactics are downright cruel. (But, so, so true, and so brilliant.) I must credit every actor -- particularly &&&Downey$$$ Jr. and &&&Cruise$$$ â€” for their performances, and for making their characters more than stereotypes for cheap laughs.The more you know about Hollywood, the more you will appreciate the film. If not, just go and laugh at the genre. It takes balls to leave in a scene discussing how Blue-Ray conquered HD-DVD (and expect anyone to fine it funny). But it is funny.To utterly relish the insanity, brush up on 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'.They got it so right. So, so, so right.
