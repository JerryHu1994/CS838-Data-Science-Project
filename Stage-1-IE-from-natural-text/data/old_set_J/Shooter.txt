I came into this film with loads of skepticism, but I came out feeling completely the opposite. Shooter takes you into the life of retired Marine Scout Sniper &&&Bob Lee Swagger$$$, who retired after a mission went completely wrong. He is called back to give information as to how someone would be able to kill the president from over a mile away. He ends up being framed for the attempted murder of the president, and the murder of an archbishop of Ethopia, and must prove his innocence, at any cost.&&&Mark Wahlberg$$$ does a perfect job of portraying a detached veteran who has no respect for the government, and really brings the character to you. He is backed up by an outstanding &&&Michael Pena$$$ and &&&Danny Glover$$$ who add to the film like no one else could. The only real complaint is that &&&Kate Mara's$$$ character, the widowed wife of &&&Swagger's$$$ best friend seems to only play two emotions, distressed, or hysterical, and it does get annoying, though she plays the part well. &&&Elias Kosteas$$$ did a good job playing &&&Jack Payne$$$, a borderline psychotic government agent, though at times his part seems over the top. All in all this film blew me away and I couldn't have loved it more. Anyone who is into action movies of any kind definitely needs to see this movie.
