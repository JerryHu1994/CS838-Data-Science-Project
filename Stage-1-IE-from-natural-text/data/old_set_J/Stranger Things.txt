It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story. I have been a fan of &&&David Harbour$$$ Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing. You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in.
