"I Think" its a good idea to know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it.  Now that I've seen it, the commercials on television seem to be giving away too much.  With that in mind DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!Its a hard movie to pinpoint.  Its not like any other movie I've ever seen, in that a character exists that is not real.  &&&John Nash's$$$ mind is the reality of the movie and its not until the movie is half over that you realize this and its jarring that you've been taken on a ride with this man's illness, and accepted it as the real world.  Its also a very heartbreaking thing.From the middle point, &&&John$$$ and you see the world differently because he starts to receive treatment.&&&Russell Crowe$$$ does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance.  Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002.  He really is that good. Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent &&&Jennifer Connelly$$$, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie.  Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect. I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over. I was shown a person at their best and the worse and everything in between, by a masterful actor at the top of his game.I am sure &&&Ron Howard$$$ deserves a lot of credit that he won't get, too.
