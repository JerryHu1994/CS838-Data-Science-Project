 The Rock was an awesome film to see in the cinema. Over the top action, amasing driving scenes, an all round enjoyable film. Excellent casting of &&&Sean Connery$$$ and &&&Nicholas Cage$$$, interesting idea, ex-military take tour hostage and threaten chemical warfare. But it's all in a days work for the FBI. Scientist risks life and limb to rescue city while pregnant girlfriend looks on. &&&Sean Connery'$$$ character is portrayed as a hard ex SAS spy and &&&Nicholas Cage$$$ is the mild mannered Scientist/Chemical Expert. Good film, not too taxing on the brain and overall, very enjoyable! A must see for Action Fans.
