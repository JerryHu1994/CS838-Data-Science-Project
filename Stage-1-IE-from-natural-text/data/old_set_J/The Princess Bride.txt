 This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.&&&Cary Elwes$$$ and &&&Robin Wright$$$ are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. &&&Mandy Patinkin$$$ is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. &&&Chris Sarandon$$$ is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy.
