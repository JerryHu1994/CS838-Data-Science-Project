The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies &&&Tim Burton's$$$ unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for &&&Ichabod Crane$$$ and a "story behind the story" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere.The dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's &&&Johnny Depp$$$ who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over-the-top portrayal of the anti-hero, &&&Ichabod Crane$$$, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear.The lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman "to life", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before. It's unlikely that this cinematic version will ever be surpassed. Superb!
