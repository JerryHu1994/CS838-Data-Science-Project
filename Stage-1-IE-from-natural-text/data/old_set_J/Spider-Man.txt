 I thoroughly enjoyed "Spider-Man," which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director &&&Sam Raimi$$$ kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  &&&Tobey Maguire$$$ was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the "&&&Peter Parker$$$: The Amazing Spider-Man" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of &&&Peter Parker's$$$.  Especially good were &&&Rosemary Harris$$$ and &&&Cliff Robertson$$$ as Aunt &&&May$$$ and Uncle &&&Ben Parker$$$, &&&Willem Dafoe$$$ as &&&Norman Osborn$$$/the Green Goblin, &&&James Franco$$$ as &&&Harry Osborn$$$, and &&&Kirsten Dunst$$$ as &&&Mary Jane Watson$$$.  And in a small but memorable role, &&&J.K. Simmons$$$ ("Oz," Law & Order") as newspaper publisher &&&J. Jonah Jameson$$$ was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by &&&Willem Dafoe$$$ -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. "The Amazing Spider-Man" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that &&&Sam Raimi$$$ has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old).
