* Stage 1: [Information extraction from natural text](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-838-spring-2018/project-description/stage-1)
In this project, we build a learning based information extractor which can extract person names from natural text documents. The data we used is IMDb user comments.

You can call the pipeline with the below commands

```
cd Stage-1-IE-from-natural-text
bash stage1_pipeline.sh

```


* Stage 2: [Crawling and extrating structured data from web pages]
